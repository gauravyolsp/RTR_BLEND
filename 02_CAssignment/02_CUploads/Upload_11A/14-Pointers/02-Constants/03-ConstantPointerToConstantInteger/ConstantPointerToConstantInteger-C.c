    // The following line gives error and is hence commented out.
    // We cannot alter the 'ptr' value as 'ptr' is "a constant pointer to constant integer".
    // With respect to the pointer, the value it points to is constant AND the pointer itself ia also constant.
    // Uncomment it and see the error.

    // ptr++;

    // The Following line also give error and is hence commented out.
    // We cannot alther the value stored in 'ptr' is "Aconstant pointer to constant integer"
    // With respect to the pointer, the value it points to is ci=onstant AND the pointer itself is also constant.
    // Uncomment it and see the error.

    // (*ptr)++;

    return(0);
}

// CONCLUSION
// As "ptr" is a "constant pointer to a constant integer" -  we can change the value stored at address "ptr" AND we cannot change the 'ptr'(addresss) itself.
// We can change the value of the variable (num) individually - whose address is contained in "ptr".
// We cannot also change "the value at address of ptr" -  we can change the value of "num" with respect to "ptr" => (*ptr)++ is NOT allowed.
// We cannot change the value of 'ptr' => That is we cannot store a new address inside 'ptr' => so, ptr++ is NOT allowed
